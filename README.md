# ✨ Personal Website ✨

Welcome to my personal website (https://dylanyoung.dev) which runs on Next.js on Netlify (I frequently blog on the personal site about this topic), as well as using Sanity.io as the CMS.

## Getting Started

To get started, with the web client (since this is a multi-repo) you can run the following commands:

```
cd web

npm install

npm run dev
```

This will allow you to run the application locally.

## Running Sanity Studio

Coming Soon
